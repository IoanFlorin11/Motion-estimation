# Motion-estimation
## Overview

This project implements a motion estimation algorithm using the Three-Step Search (TSS) technique to predict video frames, enhancing video compression efficiency. The algorithm processes video frames by segmenting them into macroblocks, performing block matching using the Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) metric, and reconstructing target frames from residuals.

## Features:

- **Motion Estimation Algorithm:** Utilizes the TSS technique to predict video frames.
- **Block Segmentation:** Segments images into macroblocks for detailed analysis.
- **MAD Calculation:** Implements Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) for accurate block matching.
- **Frame Reconstruction:** Reconstructs target frames from residuals for efficient compression.
- **Performance Metrics:** Provides residual metrics to evaluate the accuracy of motion estimation.

## Technologies

- **NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **OS: For file handling and system operations.

## Usage

To use the motion estimation algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Images**

   Ensure you have two image files ready:
   - **Anchor Frame:** The reference frame for motion estimation.
   - **Target Frame:** The frame you want to predict or reconstruct.

   Place these images in the same directory as the script, or provide the correct paths to them.

2. **Run the Script**
   You can execute the script in colab or run it in the py format.
   Execute the main script by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Review the Output

After running the script, check the `OUTPUT` directory for the following files:

- **`targetFrame.png`**: The original target frame.
- **`cadruPrezis.png`**: The predicted frame based on the motion estimation algorithm.
- **`CadruRezidual.png`**: The residual frame showing the difference between the target and predicted frames.
- **`CadruTintaReconstruit.png`**: The reconstructed target frame from the residual and predicted frames.
- **`naiveResidualFrame.png`**: The residual frame computed using a naive approach for comparison.
- **`results.txt`**: A text file containing residual metrics comparing the performance of the motion estimation algorithm to naive methods.
cadruPrezis.png: The predicted frame generated by the motion estimation algorithm, showing the estimated result based on the anchor frame.
CadruRezidual.png: The residual frame that illustrates the difference between the target frame and the predicted frame, highlighting the discrepancies.
CadruTintaReconstruit.png: The reconstructed target frame, created by combining the residual and the predicted frame to approximate the original target frame.
naiveResidualFrame.png: The residual frame computed using a naive approach, provided for comparison to evaluate the performance improvements of the motion estimation algorithm.
results.txt: A text file containing metrics for evaluating the accuracy of the motion estimation algorithm, comparing it to naive methods.

## Results

The `results.txt` file will contain the following metrics:

- **Residual Metric**: The residual metric calculated for the frame predicted by the motion estimation algorithm. This value indicates the accuracy of the motion estimation compared to the target frame.
- **Naive Residual Metric**: The residual metric computed using a naive approach, providing a baseline for comparison.

These metrics are used to evaluate and compare the performance of the motion estimation algorithm against simpler methods.
